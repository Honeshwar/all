          Countdown to the 2023 Chhattisgarh Assembly Election: Strategies and

          As the upcoming election date approaches, we reflect on the political
          dynamics in Chattisgarh following the first phase, which saw over a
          70% voter turnout. The end of the 15-year BJP rule in 2018 marked a
          significant shift in the state's political landscape after Raman
          Singh's era as the Chief Minister. The Congress party managed to wrest
          the seat from the BJP, securing a substantial 10% lead which
          previously used to be marginal. At present, the Congress holds power
          in the state under Chief Minister Bhupesh Singh Baghel. This article
          delves into the strategies employed by the Congress to reclaim its
          power and the BJP's efforts to regain influence and establish a
          presence in the state.

        <p>
          In contrast to the BJP, which leans heavily on its central leadership
          that is Prime Minister Modi, the Congress, has granted significant
          autonomy to Baghel in shaping its electoral strategy in Chhattisgarh.
          Congress aims to leverage the populist measures in favour of farmers,
          tribal communities, and the underprivileged that the Bhupesh Baghel
          government has introduced in the state. The incumbent party also hopes
          to capitalise on CM Baghel's popularity, given his strong influence
          over OBC and rural voters while BJP aims to rely on the popularity of
          PM Modi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caste and religion continue to play a significant role in shaping the
          outcome of elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a public
          address in Durg, Chhattisgarh, emphasised that the most significant
          caste in the country is that of the poor, stating that he is their
          'sevak' (servant).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Baghel government introduced the reservation amendment Bills in
          December 2022, which will provide 27% reservations to Other Backward
          Classes, 32% to Scheduled Tribes (32%), 13% to Scheduled Castes and 4%
          to Economically Weaker Sections in both employment and educational
          institutions. These bills can influence voters from these communities
          to vote for Congress.
        </p>

        <p>
          The BJP has intensified its Hindutva agenda in Chhattisgarh, with a
          group of hardline candidates leading the party's charge. Amit Shah has
          highlighted the rise in religious conversions especially of tribals
          under Congress’s rule. The BJP party has also presented a list of 69
          allegations against Congress, including instances of mass conversion
          of tribals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among these allegations is the claim that the State Congress was using
          Naxals to target BJP workers, resulting in the deaths of five
          individuals in Maoist attacks over the past year. However, Congress
          claims it has reduced the violence in the region. There are
          accusations and counter-accusations regarding secret alliances between
          Maoists and local leaders from both the ruling Congress and the
          opposition BJP.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a bid to counter the rising influence of Hindutva forces within the
          State, the Congress party is adopting a nuanced approach by projecting
          Baghel as a devout Hindu hailing from the Kurmi caste. As such, the
          political strategy of the Congress government in Chhattisgarh has
          taken a decisive right turn. In 2021, the state inaugurated the Ram
          Van Gaman Tourism Circuit, focusing on developing sites in
          Chhattisgarh believed to be associated with Lord Rama and Sita during
          their 14-year exile.
        </p>

        <p>
          The issues of tribals have taken a centre stage in the election
          campaign. Contentious matters such as coal mining and environmental
          concerns as well as mass conversions have sparked political debates.
          In contrast, Congress continues to criticise the BJP government for
          its mistreatment of tribal communities. During a public meeting in
          Jagdalpur, a tribal-dominated area in Bastar, Rahul Gandhi criticised
          the BJP for disrespecting tribals by referring to them as 'vanvasis'
          instead of 'adivasis'. He pledged to eliminate the term 'vanvasi' from
          the country, highlighting the derogatory connotations associated with
          it. He also cited incidents of BJP MLA’s disrespecting the tribal
          community.
        </p>

        <p>
          BJP's election campaign relies heavily on emphasising the alleged
          scams committed by the Congress government. Prime Minister Narendra
          Modi highlighted a series of scams perpetrated by the state
          government, and accused them of looting the people of Chhattisgarh to
          the fullest. He specifically mentioned the PSC scam and Mahadev APP
          scam, along with additional instances such as liquor, cement, rice,
          and gotham scams.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Enforcement Directorate's have alleged that promoters of the
          Mahadev betting app had allegedly paid Rs 508 crore to Chief Minister
          Bhupesh Baghel. In response, the Congress retaliated, claiming that
          the ED's accusations against Baghel were part of a BJP conspiracy to
          tarnish his image. Consequently, the saffron party is accused of
          misusing central agencies, including the ED and the CBI, to smear the
          image of opposition leaders.
        </p>

        <h6>Development Schemes and Promises</h6>

        <p>
          The Congress party, recognizing the significance of the farmer's vote
          bank, has implemented several initiatives and promises to garner
          support from the farming community. During the 2018 Assembly polls,
          the Congress pledged to pay paddy farmers a bonus of Rs 600 per
          quintal over and above the Centre-mandated minimum support price for
          the crop. After winning the election, the party followed through on
          this promise, boosting its credibility among farmers.
        </p>

        <p>
          BJP and Congress have both engaged in a fierce battle over this voter
          base. However amidst this political competition, it is the farmers who
          stand to gain the most. The ruling party has promised to procure 20
          quintals of paddy from farmers at a rate of Rs 3,200 per quintal as
          opposed to the BJP's offer of Rs 3,100 at 21 quintals. Furthermore,
          the Congress proposed a substantial Rs 6,000 per sack rate for tendu
          leaves, overshadowing the BJP's Rs 5,500 offer. In addition to these
          measures, the Congress government has increased the assistance amount
          for landless farmers from ₹7,000 to ₹10,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the Congress and the BJP have outlined promising initiatives to
          support youth and education in their respective manifestos. The BJP
          and Congress, have committed to providing a substantial 50 percent
          subsidy on business loans, aiming to encourage the growth of small
          businesses and startups in the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the BJP's manifesto includes a provision for a
          monthly travel allowance for students commuting to college,
          facilitated through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), ensuring financial
          support for students' educational needs.They also aim to set up
          educational institutions such as IIT, AIIMS etc in the state. The
          Congress party has promised free education up to post-graduation.
        </p>

        <p>
          For appealing to women voters, BJP, under its proposed 'Mahtari Vandan
          Scheme,' pledges substantial financial aid of Rs 12,000 per year to
          married women, along with providing cooking gas cylinders at a reduced
          rate of Rs 500 each for women from impoverished families.Congress has
          promised a direct subsidy of Rs 500 on gas cylinder refills as well
          which would be directly transferred to an individual's bank account.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both parties have promised a provision of free medical treatment up to
          an impressive Rs 10 lakh for underprivileged citizens. However, the
          Congress has made significant strides by extending the coverage to
          Above Poverty Line (APL) families, elevating the threshold to Rs 5
          lakh from the previous Rs 50,000.
        </p>

        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
        <p>
          Amidst the predictions favouring the Congress in the upcoming polls,
          the question looms large: can the BJP government successfully reverse
          the current tide in its favour? The BJP government initially focused
          on national rather than regional concerns but has recently shifted its
          approach, emphasising local issues, as evident from its welfare scheme
          promises. The candidate selection and campaign strategy highlight the
          party's reliance on promoting a Hindutva image and tarnishing the
          Congress image through corruption allegations. However, the core of
          Chhattisgarh politics revolves around the tribal and farmer voter
          base. Securing the support of this crucial demographic is imperative
          for winning the election.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outcome of this election holds significant importance as it will
          establish a precedent for the strategies that need to be adopted in
          the upcoming 2024 elections.
