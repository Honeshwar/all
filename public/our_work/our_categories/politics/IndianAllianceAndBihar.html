          Electoral Dynamics: A look at Bihar’s Political Landscape

        <p>
          The BJP's stronghold lies in India's Hindi heartland, encompassing
          states like Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and
          Rajasthan. However, Bihar stands out as the only state where the party
          has never secured a majority on its own. This makes the political
          landscape of Bihar very intriguing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision by Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar who has been
          the Chief Minister of Bihar for the past 15 years to terminate his
          alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal led by Lalu Prasad Yadav , in
          favour of rekindling ties with the BJP, is a significant setback to
          the INDIA bloc. It led to the collapse of the ruling coalition in
          Bihar, which included JD(U), RJD, and Congress. Kumar's remarks upon
          resigning, regarding the lack of cohesion within the INDIA bloc come
          just months before they face the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
          further underscore the challenges faced by the opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this move may have backfired. Nitish Kumar's credibility in
          Bihar has taken a hit, with people questioning his political
          integrity. Nonetheless, the shift in alliances presents a newfound
          advantage for the BJP in what was previously an opposition-dominated
          state. But there arises an opportunity to solidify a people-friendly
          common agenda like unemployment for the opposition. With Bihar holding
          40 Lok Sabha seats, its political significance cannot be understated.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article delves into the complex dynamics of Bihar's political
          scene and its implications for the future of the INDIA bloc in the
          state.

            <h5>Electoral Scenario</h5>
            <p>
              Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in
              voter turnout in general elections, with a surge of over 10%.
              However, Bihar has consistently recorded the lowest average voter
              turnout in the past three assembly elections among all states. In
              2019 general elections, Bihar witnessed the second-lowest voter
              turnout in the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Female voter turnout surpassed male turnout for the third
              consecutive assembly election, with women comprising 59.7% of
              voters compared to men at 54.6% in the 2020 Assembly Elections.
              This trend of higher female participation has been observed for
              over a decade, attributed to the developmental policies and
              programs implemented by Nitish Kumar's government since 2005.
              These initiatives, such as the Jeevika program, and the 50%
              reservation for women in panchayat elections, have facilitated
              greater involvement and decision-making among women at the village
              and panchayat levels.
            </p>

            <p>
              Yet, despite these positive developments, issues such as
              prohibition and allegations of increased petty corruption at the
              grassroots level, coupled with perceived inaction by the chief
              minister regarding illicit alcohol trade, have left a significant
              portion of women feeling disillusioned.

            <h5>General Elections</h5>
            <p>
              After leading a formidable alliance with the BJP for 17 years, the
              JDU severed ties in June 2013 due to objections over Narendra
              Modi's prime ministerial candidature. The BJP-led alliance secured
              victory in Bihar's 2014 Lok Sabha elections with 31 seats won,
              attributed to the 'Modi wave' and anti-incumbency sentiment. JD(U)
              won just 2 seats and RJD won 4 seats who were dominant political
              forces in the state.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Lok Sabha, the NDA alliance, consisting of the BJP, JDU,
              and LJP, currently holds 39 out of 40 seats, and secured a
              significant 53.25% vote share. Interestingly, the BJP's vote share
              witnessed a decline of around 6% in 2019 compared to the 2014
              general elections. It's worth mentioning that in 2014, the BJP
              contested 30 out of the 40 seats, whereas in 2019, it contested
              only 17 seats. The BJP sacrificed five seats it had won in 2014 to
              accommodate the JD(U) as an equal partner in the alliance who had
              contested alone in 2014. Both the BJP and LJP achieved a 100%
              success rate by winning all the seats they contested in 2019. The
              JD(U) saw a remarkable improvement from its performance in 2014,
              increasing its seat tally from two to 16.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, despite being the leading opposition party, the
              RJD failed to secure any seats in the 2019 elections and
              experienced a 5% decrease in its vote share.The RJD contested an
              election for the first time in Lalu Prasad’s absence. The Congress
              managed to secure just one seat.

            <h5>Assembly Elections</h5>
            <p>
              In the 2015 Assembly Elections, the Mahagathbandhan, comprising
              the JDU-RJD and INC alliance, secured a resounding victory,
              winning a total of 178 seats and sweeping the state. The RJD
              emerged as the party with the highest number of seats, capturing
              80 seats with a vote share of 18.4%. Interestingly, although the
              BJP garnered the highest vote share at 24.4%, it failed to secure
              a victory in the state. The Congress, with a modest 6.7% vote
              share, managed to win 27 seats. However, in 2017, the government
              collapsed as Nitish Kumar returned to the NDA fold, realigning
              with the BJP-led alliance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to the 2020 elections, where the NDA alliance
              clinched a narrow victory. Interestingly, both the National
              Democratic Alliance and the Mahagathbandhan ended up with
              identical vote shares at 37.2%, but with different seat counts –
              125 against 110 in the 243-member assembly. Despite emerging as
              the party with the largest number of seats, the Rashtriya Janata
              Dal lost the election. Despite gaining 74 seats, up from 53 in
              2015, the BJP's vote share dropped by 6%. The INC, on the other
              hand, experienced a 2% increase in vote share but secured 19
              seats, down by 8 from 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
              JD(U) suffered a significant setback, winning only 43 seats, a
              decrease from 71. Additionally, the Communist Party of India
              (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation (CPI[ML]L) secured 12 seats with
              just 3.16% vote share. This election also witnessed a resurgence
              of the Left, with CPI(ML)L winning 12 seats with just 3.16% vote
              share, and the emergence of a new player in Bihar, the All India
              Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), which secured five seats in
              the eastern tip of the state.
            </p>
            <p>
              The surprising victory of the NDA over the MGB was attributed to
              various factors, including anti-incumbency sentiments, the
              humanitarian and economic crisis caused by COVID-19, and a focused
              campaign on jobs and unemployment led by the RJD. Political
              analysts primarily pointed to women voters, recalling the misrule
              of the RJD, and the diversion of Muslim votes by parties like the
              All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen, to explain the NDA's
              unexpected success.

            <h5>Seat Sharing Issues</h5>
            <p>
              The allocation of Lok Sabha seats in Bihar has become a source of
              contention for both the NDA and the INDIA bloc. The INDIA bloc,
              consisting of the Congress, RJD led by Lalu Prasad Yadav, and Left
              parties, namely CPI (ML), CPI (M), and CPI. The CPI (ML) makes it
              complex and adds to the challenge of resolving the seat allocation
              issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to these complexities, the NDA in Bihar must also
              accommodate several smaller parties during seat-sharing
              discussions. Notably, the LJP is no longer a single party, with
              two factions led by Chirag Paswan and Pashupati Kumar Paras.
              Furthermore, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by Jitan Ram
              Manjhi and the Rashtriya Lok Janta Dal led by Upendra Kushwaha
              have aligned with the BJP.
            </p>
            <p>
              It remains uncertain whether the BJP and JD(U) will opt to contest
              fewer seats to accommodate their allies. The intricate
              negotiations surrounding seat allocation highlight the intricate
              political landscape of Bihar, where various parties vie for
              representation and influence in the Lok Sabha.

            <h5>Why did he leave?</h5>
            <p>
              Bihar, where the Congress only won one seat in the previous
              election, posed a challenge for the opposition alliance when it
              came to seat sharing talks. The appointment of Mallikarjun Kharge
              as the chairperson of the opposition alliance further complicated
              matters for Nitish Kumar. Nitish Kumar wanted this position and
              had ambitions to become the PM as well, but his demands faced
              opposition from within the alliance, including figures like Mamata
              Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal. His departure from the alliance was
              influenced by concerns over his diminishing role within it and the
              ambitions of others, like Lalu Prasad, who wanted his son to
              become the Chief Minister. Despite uncertainties over leadership
              roles and alliances, Nitish Kumar's decision to rejoin the NDA
              showcases his personal ambitions and the changing political
              landscape in Bihar.

            <h5>Socio-Political factors</h5>
            <p>
              The political landscape of Bihar has been marked by a sense of
              continuity and stability, often revolving around charismatic
              leaders. Previously, Lalu Prasad Yadav held sway for 15 years,
              garnering support from a coalition of Muslim and Yadav voters. In
              the last decade, however, Bihar has been synonymous with its Chief
              Minister, Nitish Kumar.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 2015 elections, a significant shift occurred as the
              Mahagathbandhan alliance, comprising the JDU, RJD, Congress, and
              Left parties, garnered strong support from Muslims, as well as the
              majority of OBC and EBC castes. This was a departure from the
              political dynamics of the past, where different alliances had the
              backing of various caste groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              Historically, during the 17-year rule of the JDU-BJP coalition,
              the NDA enjoyed support from upper castes, Kurmis, Kushwahas, a
              substantial portion of EBC and SC castes, and a segment of
              Muslims. Conversely, during Lalu Prasad's tenure, the RJD
              consolidated support from OBC, EBC, and SC castes, alongside
              Muslims.
            </p>
            <p>
              The recent electoral victories of the RJD have mirrored historical
              trends, especially during periods of high voter turnout, such as
              when the Mandal Commission recommendations were implemented and
              OBC reservations were enforced, prior to the creation of
              Jharkhand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Mahagathbandhan is now seeking to revive Mandal politics by
              leveraging census data to increase quotas for OBCs, SCs, and STs
              up to 65%. However, the crucial question remains whether this
              caste-based political strategy can challenge the popularity of

              beneficiaries of central government schemes. Additionally, the
              impact of events like the Ayodhya temple inauguration on voter
              sentiments in the heartland is yet to be determined.
