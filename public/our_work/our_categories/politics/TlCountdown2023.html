          Nine years after the establishment of the state, with BRS (formerly
          Telangana Rashtra Samithi) as the ruling party, it now confronts
          numerous challenges in securing a third term in the upcoming assembly
          elections. The regional party is under threat from a resurgent
          Congress, as well as the BJP, which is attempting to establish a
          foothold in the state

          The current Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekhar Rao, spearheaded the
          movement for Telangana's separate statehood, earning him immense
          popularity among the state's residents. However Congress, buoyed by
          its recent victory in Karnataka, has emerged as a credible contender
          in the state. The party enjoys significant support, indicating a neck
          to neck competition between the two. While the BJP is not expected to
          win many seats, its presence could sway some votes, potentially
          impacting the outcome for either of the main parties making this
          assembly election a triangular contest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ruling BRS in Telangana celebrated the state's formation with an
          extensive 21-day event this year, highlighting
          <b> KCR's crucial role in the statehood </b> movement. KCR is
          depending on these sentiments to secure a third consecutive term.
          However, Congress is also trying to take credit for the party's
          formation as the UPA government at the Centre in 2009 approved the
          bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. One of Congress's six strategies
          involves granting 250 square yard plots to Telangana movement
          fighters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BRS government, which currently holds power, faces severe
          criticism from rival parties regarding alleged corruption, rising
          unemployment and unfulfilled promises. The BJP party accused BRS of
          rampant corruption and equating their actions to "daylight dacoity"
          and claims there has been a lack of development in the state.
          According to BJP, the BRS rule has led to the enrichment of specific
          families, such as the BRS, and KCR families, while the common people
          of Telangana have suffered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Congress, drawing inspiration from the successful "Pay CM" campaign in
          Karnataka, launched 'THE DEALER – All dealings are done here,' a
          social media initiative targeting alleged illegal activities involving
          the BRS government. The corruption allegations by Congress focus on
          misappropriation of funds, particularly in projects like
          <b>Kaleshwaram lift irrigation</b>, where Congress claims that
          thousands of crores were syphoned off. Additionally, they highlight
          the sale of significant assets, like the outer ring road, which the
          previous Congress government had built but was allegedly sold off by
          the BRS government.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, BRS defends its position by highlighting
          significant schemes such as Mission Kakatiya (restoration of defunct
          irrigation tanks) and Mission Bhagiratha (bringing piped drinking
          water to every doorstep) and major irrigation projects that have led
          to the development of the state. They emphasise their provision of
          round-the-clock, free-of-cost power supply to farmers, in contrast to
          other states like Karnataka,where the Congress government allegedly
          provides only limited hours of power to the agriculture sector.
          Recently Congress TPCC chief received criticism for ridiculing the
          Rythu Bandhu scheme and claiming three hours of power was enough to
          cultivate three acres of land in the USA. The BRS government is
          essentially relying on the sentiment that all the
          <b> welfare schemes given by the KCR </b> government would be lost
          forever if Congress comes into power. Following are the Initiatives
          targeting welfare and empowerment in Telangana:

          PM Modi strategically announced the formation of a
          <b>national turmeric board</b> addressing a long-standing demand of
          farmers, just days before the state's election schedule. This move was
          aimed at garnering support from the farming community. In response,
          KTR, the working president of BRS criticised the announcement,
          questioning its sincerity and implying it might be a political
          gimmick. He expressed scepticism by comparing it to the unresolved
          issue of the women's reservation bill, suggesting that the turmeric
          board might not materialise as promised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Telangana faces an unemployment crisis due to cancelled TSPSC exams,
          leaving frustrated youth in search of stable jobs. Rival parties have
          slammed the ruling party for exam paper leaks as well as rising
          unemployment soaring at 15.1%. They have also highlighted unfulfilled
          promises of BRS of creating one lakh government jobs and have pledged
          youth job opportunities and skill development if voted into power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BJP government has pledged to appoint an individual from the OBC
          caste as the Chief Minister of the state, challenging the BRS
          government to do the same. They argue that parties like BRS and
          Congress are family-centric, aiming for individuals like Rahul Gandhi
          and KCR's son to hold positions like the PM or CM. The Congress party
          is attempting to gain the support of the OBC community. However, this
          task is challenging because the party is widely recognized as the
          <b>"Reddy party"</b> due to a significant number of candidates that
          contest belong to the forward caste background. Although they have
          promised a caste census here in Telangana as well and have prominent
          dalit leaders it might not be enough.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to the Congress, there is an alleged "understanding" between
          BJP, BRS, and AIMIM. Congress repeatedly questions the reasons behind
          BRS's support for the BJP on various occasions, such as during the
          demonetisation period. Regardless of the accuracy of these
          allegations, the perception of these parties collaborating is enough
          to raise concerns. BJP has found to shake off these claims
          challenging. AIMIM which is contesting for nine seats in Hyderabad,
          led by prominent leader Asaduddin Owaisi who openly expresses its
          support for BRS and has unabashedly called upon Muslim voters in the
          state to vote for BRS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Congress has promised six key schemes and policies that might help
          them win over the election. In the lead-up to the elections, both the
          Congress and BRS parties have unveiled ambitious welfare schemes
          aiming to capture voters' attention. Congress announced six
          guarantees, namely, Mahalakshmi, Rythu Bharosa, Gruha Jyothi,
          Indiramma Indlu, Yuva Vikasam and Cheyutha. Under these schemes they
          have promised benefits like a monthly stipend of Rs 2500 for women,
          affordable LPG cylinders, Rs 4000 monthly pension and free RTC bus
          travel. They also emphasised enhancing existing schemes like Rythu
          Bandhu and providing free electricity and constructing government
          schools in every district.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, BRS, led by KCR, countered with competitive
          offerings, including a Rs 3000 stipend for poor eligible women and
          extensive health insurance coverage up to Rs 15 lakhs among others.
          They also <b>raised the Rythu Bandhu</b> monetary incentive
          significantly, offering up to Rs 16,000 annually, surpassing Congress'
          promise of Rs 15,000, which currently stands at Rs 10,000 per year.
          Both parties focused on bolstering welfare schemes while the BJP
          government continues to highlight welfare schemes at the centre.
        </p>

        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
        <p>
          Will the BRS government overcome anti-incumbency sentiments and secure
          a third consecutive term, or will people give Congress a chance? This
          question lies at the heart of the Congress party’s campaign focus.
          Telangana was founded on the promise of improved opportunities,
          employment, and overall growth, reflecting the aspirations of its
          people. However, many of these promises remain unfulfilled, fostering
          a desire for change among the populace. The growing support for the
          Congress indicates a shift in public sentiment, although the ultimate
          choice remains uncertain.
