          Dhruv Research Pollster Ranking
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every time an election takes place in India (which is quite frequent),
          TV screens and newspaper pages are flooded with opinion polls, exit
          polls and other such surveys trying to predict winners and losers.
          With an explosion in the number of polling agencies and election
          forecasters in the last decade and a half, this trend is only
          increasing. While it can be understood that one of the objectives of
          these polls and forecasts is to make people better informed, given the
          increasing mistrusts and doubts due to the polls being frequently
          incorrect, they usually end up confusing people more than informing
          them. Each survey tries to prove itself as the best by citing various
          parameters that suit it like largest sample size, its past accuracy in
          calling elections, the duration for which it has been in the field and
          therefore understands the “pulse of the public” etc. etc. All of these
          convenience based metrics end up further cluttering the issue instead
          of actually making it clear to people on which polls to trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          This issue got flared up again recently when nearly all pollsters got
          the exit poll for Bihar Assembly election 2020 wrong. Most pollsters
          expected RJD led Mahagathbandhan to win while some called a close
          contest with edge to Mahagathbandhan over National Democratic
          Alliance. Actual result, however, was a close contest with a narrow
          NDA victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pollster like Axis MyIndia, which had had a consistent track record of
          correctly predicting the elections in at least last 2 years including
          the 2019 Lok Sabha, had to issue a clarification on its wrong
          prediction while the CVoter which had not had much success until
          recently came very close to predicting this election correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Which Polls to trust?” This question has also baffled us at Dhruv
          Research. What are the objective parameters one can use to determine
          the accuracy levels of various pollsters? Are some pollsters
          objectively better than the others? These are the questions that led
          us to start working on this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          First step was to collect the data for as many polls as possible. For
          this we had to rely on the data available in the public domain on the
          internet. We compiled the Exit and Opinion poll data of 843 polls
          starting from 2005. We managed to get data for 48 pollsters in this
          timeframe where the number of polls for a pollster ranges from 1 to
          220. We included only those polls which we were able to attribute to a
          polling agency. Most of the polls in the public domain tend to be
          sponsored by the media houses, in our methodology, such polls are
          attributed to polling agencies and not the news channel. We removed
          the polls for which could only find out the media channels that
          carried them and not the polling agencies which conducted them,
          forcing us to revise our number downwards to 705.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of polls available online is very less for the period
          before 2010. However, we were able to get a considerable number of
          polls from the year 2014 onwards. Below is a detailed break up of the
          year wise number of polls.

        <p>
          Now the question comes, what should be the parameters on which we can
          compare these polls and pollsters. One thing that comes to mind is a
          simple metric, that in how many elections have they called the winners
          and losers correctly. However, there are many drawbacks in rating or
          ranking the pollsters only on the basis of calling the election winner
          correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian elections are far from a simple contest between winner and
          loser. There is almost always some third force that has to be taken
          into account. Take for example, out of the 8 major state elections
          that took place in 2018 and 2019 (apart from the ones that took place
          with general election) any party or pre poll alliance could gain a
          majority in only 4 of them (Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Maharashtra and
          Jharkhand). Even in this list it was for the first time in Jharkhand
          that any party or pre poll alliance got the majority. Even in states
          like Rajasthan and Haryana which seemed straight forward according to
          most of the polls, parties that were expected to win comprehensively
          did not win the election
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this does not mean that polls got those elections entirely
          wrong. Most of them were directionally correct, parties that were
          expected to win ended up being the largest party in each election. The
          problem instead, lies in the magnitude of the lead that was assigned
          to the winning party over the losing party. In other words the margin
          between the top 2 parties is what the most polls got wrong. We can say
          that the closer the poll predicted this margin to the actual result,
          the better a poll will be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Measuring the margin between the top two parties is a more nuanced
          measure than just looking if the winner was called correctly. Calling
          the winner gets tricky and difficult in races that are too close to
          call and actual differences may be equivalent to the polling error. In
          recent Madhya Pradesh elections, INC led BJP by merely 5 seats (out of
          230) and a lot of pollsters got it wrong. It is in such cases that our
          parameter of margin comes into play. The pollster who may have called
          the election to INC by giving it a lead of 20 Seats is much further
          from the actual result than someone who may have called the election
          for BJP with a lead of 5 seats.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, in our view reflects the public opinion more accurately, which
          should be the primary concern of the pollster. Calling elections right
          or wrong is just a corollary of getting the public opinion right.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have to acknowledge the fact that not all elections are equal
          when it comes to predicting the winner or even the margin of victory.
          There are certain elections that almost every polster has gotten
          massively wrong. Chhattisgarh election of 2018 is one such example
          where the highest seat margin predicted between INC and BJP was 34,
          but INC ended up getting 53 seats more than BJP. Now if we are
          comparing the errors of a pollster with respect to the actual result,
          we will not be acknowledging this fact. Also, it will give an undue
          advantage to the pollsters who might have chosen to skip polling in
          such tough to call states (for whatever reasons). Hence, in our view
          it makes more sense to compare an individual pollster’s error in
          polling to the average of the error of all pollsters in that election,
          rather than the absolute results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, here we would like to acknowledge that while doing our research
          on worldwide practices on rating or ranking pollsters, we came across
          an American website called fivethirtyeight.com which uses similar
          parameters to rate pollsters in the US. Our idea of using these two
          parameters at some level is also inspired by them. However, given the
          uniqueness of Indian circumstances, we have had to modify these
          ratings a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          We come back to the relevance of third forces in the Indian context.
          Third forces are almost negligible in US politics and if you know the
          margin between top two candidates, you can almost always say what are
          their exact vote shares in any given election. I.e. if a poll shows
          that democrats have a 5 point lead over the republicans, vote shares
          will most likely be around 52% and 47% for respective parties. But a 5
          point lead in an Indian election could mean anything from vote shares
          of 52%-47% to say 40%-35%. Now any framework that measures only the
          margin between the first two parties will say both polls are equally
          good. Hence in Indian context the margin, while a good measure, is
          liable to error because it can stay constant in a scenario where
          absolute vote shares or seat shares vary widely. We needed a parameter
          that can anchor the margin value that can remain constant while the
          positions of parties change drastically.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore we decided to introduce the component of how accurate the
          pollster was in predicting the seat share/ Vote Share of the party
          that it predicted to win or emerge as the largest party in the
          election. This takes care of the margin being a floating constant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with these basic concepts, let us have a look at the exact
          methodology that we used.
        </p>
        <h3>Terminology and Methodology.</h3>
        <p>
          Calling the winner correctly does not determine the performance of a
          pollster. Margin Seat-Share or Margin Vote Share are better metrics to
          predict polling accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          SError or Simple Error tells us that by what percentage points a
          pollster was off in predicting the margin between the top two
          contestants. e.g. if in a national election, a pollster predicted a
          margin of 255 seats between top 2 contestants but, the actual margin
          comes out to be 262 seats then the SError will be calculated as:
        </p>
        <p class="text-center py-3">
          SError = (mod(255-262)/543)*100 <br /><br />SError = (7/543)*100 =
          1.29%
        </p>
        <p>
          As discussed previously, in order to contextualize the performance of
          a pollster with respect to other pollsters working for the same
          election and we term this as Relative Pollster Margin Error (RPM
          Error). In order to do so, we calculated the average of SError on an
          election level (election level error) and then compared the SError of
          a poll with the election level error. e.g. if a poll ‘A’ had 10%
          SError in a particular election and the average SError for all the
          polls in that election was 15% then, RPM error for poll ‘A’ will be
          -5% which indicates that its performance was 5% better than the
          average of all the polls for that particular election. Hence in RPM
          error, the more negative a value is, the better the pollster is. We
          had to normalize the RPM over different pollsters which have done a
          number of polls ranging from 1 to 220, so that a single pollster with
          who has done only one poll does not dominate the ranking over the
          pollsters that have done multiple polls.
        </p>
        <p>Hence we have normalized RPM using the following formula</p>
        <p class="text-center py-3">
          Adjusted RPM = (RPM*Number of polls done by a pollster)/(Number of
          polls done by a pollster+Average number of polls)
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, in order to calculate how accurate the pollster was in
          predicting the party in first position we calculated First Position
          Error (FPE) tells us that by what percentage points a pollster was off
          in predicting the number of seats/votes for the party in first
          position.e.g. if in a national election, a pollster predicted party in
          first position to win 270 seats but, the actual result comes out to be
          300 seats then the FPE will be calculated as:
        </p>
        <p class="text-center py-3">
          FPE = (270-300)/543)*100<br /><br />FPE = (-30/543)*100 = -5.52%
        </p>

        <p>
          FPE can be either negative or positive, however closer it is to 0
          better it is for pollster.

          In order to calculate RPM error and FPE on a pollster level, we
          weighed it using a recency factor wherein a poll that happened
          recently received a higher weight as compared to a poll that happened
          much back in time. This was done in order to reward the pollsters that
          may not have been as accurate in the past but have improved their
          performance in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Final rating has been calculated giving 60% weightage to Adjusted RPM
          and 40% weightage to absolute value of FPE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another conundrum that we had to face was that between using seat
          share and vote share projections of pollsters. Ideally, we would like
          to use the vote share projections because, that is the quantity that
          pollsters actually calculate before converting it into seatshares for
          parties. Vote Share to seatshare conversion adds another layer of
          calculations which cannot strictly be considered a part of polling.
          However, given that almost every media house is fixated with seat
          shares, most pollsters share only seat share data in public. As
          discussed in the beginning, while for seat share projections we could
          get the data for 705 polls, the corresponding number for the vote
          share projections was only 152.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the purposes of making a start in this field, we have as of now
          calculated the ranking of pollsters using both the methodologies.
          Going forward we would like to focus more on the vote share projection
          subject to availability of the data. You can see the data we use along
          with the calculations in this link.

        <br />

        <p><b>Results of the Polster Ranking</b></p>

        <p>
          As can be seen from the above tables, Axis MyIndia and Today’s
          Chanakya consistently rank in top 2 with axis having only a slight
          edge in both methodologies. It can also be seen that Hansa and CSDS,
          which do a pretty good job in predicting the Vote shares in elections
          are not that good when it comes to predicting the seat share. On the
          Other hand, Jan Ki Baat which has done a good job in predicting seat
          share, has not given out vote shares in enough number of elections so
          s to be judged on this basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Axis MyIndia remains the best pollster in the country even after the
          wrong prediction in Bihar election, while CVoter’s relatively better
          prediction could not cover for its previous misjudgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          While VMR and IPSOS which have one of the best track records in
          calling elections correctly, tend to falter when it comes to nuanced
          understanding of the election in terms of vote share and seatshare.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we have done our best to stay objective and present to the
          public a metric that can be used to build trust in the opinion and
          exit polls in the country, we are open to improving our methodologies
          and adding more data as and when it is available, in order to update
          the ranking. We have made our data and the calculations open to the
          public on GitHub and invite the pollsters, psephologists and others to
          have a look at the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going Forward we are planning several additions to this study for a
          more nuanced understanding of the polling scene in the country. These
          include assessing the overall scenario of polling in India to see if
          the polls on average have improved or worsened in their accuracy with
          respect to the results, assessing partisan bias of the pollsters and
          looking at the correlation of the accuracy of the polls with respect
          to its proximity with the election date and how that can affect the
          rating and help us figure out a meaningful way in distinguishing
          between exit and opinion polls in terms of accuracy.
